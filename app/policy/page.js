                <p>Anti-Harassment policy</p>

                <p>
                We at SJBHS, have a firm stance against harassment of any kind. Keeping in mind the complications that may arise from the same, these are some basic guidelines to which all delegates must adhere to, failing which they shall be removed from the committee and be disqualified from MUN. The delegation may also be affected if more than one member engages in prohibited activities as mentioned below.
                </p>

                <p>
                Depending on the severity of the offense, the matter may be reported to The Principal / Teacher Co-Ordinator of the respective School/College from which the participant hails. No refund will be issued to the delegate in the aforementioned situation.
                </p>

                <p className="text-white font-semibold">
                 The following must be kept in mind before and during the conference:
                </p>
